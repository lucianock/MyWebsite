      <h3>‚úã Before starting: what is EC2?</h3>
      <p>EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is an Amazon Web Services (AWS) service that allows you to launch a virtual machine (like a remote PC) and use it as a server. Ideal for hosting your website, running tests, setting up APIs, or working on personal projects.</p>
      
      <p>AWS gives you <strong>one year free</strong> under the Free Tier plan. Take advantage of it!</p>
      
      <h3>üöÄ Step 1 ‚Äì Create your AWS account</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Go to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">aws.amazon.com</a> and register.</li>
        <li>You'll need a credit card. Don't worry, they won't charge you while you're on the free plan.</li>
        <li>Activate your account and that's it, you enter the dashboard.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h3>üñ•Ô∏è Step 2 ‚Äì Launch your EC2 instance</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>In the search bar, type "EC2" and click.</li>
        <li>Choose "Launch instance".</li>
        <li>Choose a system image (I recommend Ubuntu Server 22.04).</li>
        <li>In "Instance type" select <code>t2.micro</code> (it's the free one).</li>
        <li>Choose or create a new key pair (save it well, without this you won't be able to access).</li>
        <li>Click "Launch instance".</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>You already have your server online!</p>
      
      <h3>üîê Step 3 ‚Äì Access via SSH</h3>
      <p>If you're on Linux or Mac:</p>
      <pre><code>chmod 400 your-file.pem
ssh -i "your-file.pem" ubuntu@your-public-ip</code></pre>
      
      <p>On Windows you can use PuTTY or the new Windows terminal with OpenSSH.</p>
      
      <h3>üåê Step 4 ‚Äì Install your web</h3>
      <p>A quick example with Apache:</p>
      <pre><code>sudo apt update && sudo apt install apache2 -y</code></pre>
      
      <p>Then, copy your files to the <code>/var/www/html/</code> directory.</p>
      
      <p>You can upload your portfolio, a Laravel project, a landing page... whatever you want.</p>
      
      <h3>üì° Step 5 ‚Äì Open port 80</h3>
      <p>You need to allow HTTP traffic:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>In the EC2 panel, go to your instance.</li>
        <li>In "Security groups" edit the inbound rules.</li>
        <li>Add a new one:
          <ul>
            <li>Type: HTTP</li>
            <li>Port: 80</li>
            <li>Source: Anywhere</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>Done. Open your IP in the browser... and magic! ü™Ñ</p>
      
      <h3>üí° Final tips</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Use a free domain from <a href="https://www.freenom.com/" target="_blank">Freenom</a> and point it to your IP.</li>
        <li>You can set up a PHP server or even Node.js if you want.</li>
        <li>Make backups: EC2 can restart and lose changes if you don't use persistent volumes.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>My personal experience</h3>
      <p>I discovered this almost by chance, and it blew my mind. Being able to have a <em>free</em> server, without depending on external platforms and with total control, is a gem for any developer or curious person. I'm using it to set up my personal projects and test new tools safely.</p>
